# Contributing Guidelines for Mekanism - version 0.0.1

## Introduction ##
There are 2 reasons you might want to contribute to Mekanism:)

1) You have an issue.
2) You want to fix or add something.

## Before getting started ##

At this point you are either an old hat at working with open source software, or you don't yet feel like a master.  Either way, please take a moment and read the Open Source Guide ["How to Contribute to Open Source"](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).  It's important to understand the ecosystem and culture that you are stepping into.

## You have an issue ##

You have found something that doesn't work the way you think it should.  
Before you [submit a new issue](https://github.com/aidancbrady/Mekanism/issues) by pressing the green "New issue" button, check both the open and [the closed issues](https://github.com/aidancbrady/Mekanism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to see if your issue exists already, or it's been closed as "won't fix."

If you don't see you issue then write up and [submit a new issue](https://github.com/aidancbrady/Mekanism/issues) by pressing the green "New issue" button and following the instructions.

It's important that you follow the instructions in the issue template for a couple reasons.  The most important reason is that the template will guide you through providing the information needed for someone to reproduce and debug your issue.  

Just saying that something "doesn't work" doesn't help anyone.


## You want to fix or add something ##

Check [the issues](https://github.com/aidancbrady/Mekanism/issues) for something that interests you and try to reproduce the issue, then fix it and create a pull request.
